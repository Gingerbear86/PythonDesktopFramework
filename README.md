# PythonDesktopFramework
 This is my Python Desktop Automation Framework. I've only been coding a few months and have used GPT to help me learn along the way.

 I store and call my configurations from an ini file config.ini

 I store my elements in automation_elements

 I store my methods in both desktop_automation_methods and combined_automation_methods that is shared on my mobile framework also.

 webquasartables is my test for quasar tables, it navigates to a basic table, expands it, and then collects the data in the table and saves it to a file table_data.xlsx

webtabsariastate is my test case for testing aria states of quasar tabs.
